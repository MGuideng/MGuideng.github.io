**Learning points**

* "A ["Hello, World!" program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. "Hello, world!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it."
