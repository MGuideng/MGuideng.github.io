>_"Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go and do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive."_  
                        **- Howard Thurman**



My name is Maria and I enjoy learning new things. This website was created as a way for me to learn openly by sharing my work on side projects as they happen. This includes writing about analytics and occasional tangents on anything which gets my attention. 

I believe that learning openly is an attitude and a practice of sharing our experiences, both failures and successes. By putting our work out there, it opens it up to receiving feedback on better ways of doing things. Also, we’re all constantly learning and seeking examples that help us to make sense of our own creative processes. When we seek inspiration, ideas, and solutions, it’s often to the credit of others who are generously willing to discuss and document their own processes.

Thanks for stopping by. For feedback, inquiries, or grabbing a coffee:
