>_"Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go and do that, because what the world needs is people who have come alive."_

This website was created as a way for me to display the work I'm doing as I learn analytical tools using data on Nevada's economy.

I studied economics and statistics at UNLV. I performed strategic analyses for 10 years as a consultant at a [management consulting firm](http://www.rcg1.com/) and then a few years as an analyst for the [Governorâ€™s economic development division](http://www.diversifynevada.com/). I live in Las Vegas and my favorite applied projects cover subjects related to community development, sustainability, workforce development, real estate, industry sectors, and more in my home state.
