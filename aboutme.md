**- Howard Thurman**

I made this website as a way to display the applied work I'm doing while I learn analytical tools and report on Nevada's economy.

I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and my favorite applied projects cover subjects related to community development, sustainability, workforce development, real estate, industry sectors, and more in my home state.
